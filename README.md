# hearthstone_cards_named

This repository contains images of collectible Hearthstone cards.

It is result of Lua script which uses images from `Chris Schmich's` [hearthstone-card-images](https://github.com/schmich/hearthstone-card-images) and card descriptions from [HearthSim](https://github.com/HearthSim/hsdata) project.

Files grouped by expansions and classes.

I'm going to release script in future in another repository.

Actualized at 2018-04-26 (Witchwood expansion).
